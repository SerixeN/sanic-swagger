# Changelog

## 0.0.2 - 2018-09-07
This version bump is just for testing end to end uploading via CircleCI.
Unfortunately, I can't seem to upload two files with the same versio number, so
I needed to bump the number here.

## 0.0.1 - 2018-09-07
Initial version is uploaded manually to
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sanic-swagger/)
