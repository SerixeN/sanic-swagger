# Changelog

## 0.0.4 - 2018-10-04
Patch bump only for testing CircleCI deploys.

## 0.0.3 - 2018-09-14
Patch bump because we need the PyPI descriptor to be updated. This project was
never actually tested on 3.5 and 3.7, and it turns out that it doesn't work for
either.

## 0.0.2 - 2018-09-07
This version bump is just for testing end to end uploading via CircleCI.
Unfortunately, I can't seem to upload two files with the same versio number, so
I needed to bump the number here.

## 0.0.1 - 2018-09-07
Initial version is uploaded manually to
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sanic-swagger/)
